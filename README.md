### Multi Social API with Devise, OmniAuth for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin 
- Objective to have single user identity linked to multiple OAuth identities 
- Even if multiple OAuth identities have different emails associated with each social platform
- Twitter doesn't share user's email, so we need to get from user
- Ability to have User deselect or select multiple social logins from within their profile 
- and activate them all so, they can login with any of their profiles
- If user doesn't want to use a social login they can create a user account using devise

#### Step 1: setup devise
- `rails g devise:install` devise outputs some manual steps, be sure to do steps 1, 3, 5 manually, 
- `rails g devise User` creates User model
- Note: if your server is running be sure to stop the server before running rake command
- `rake db:migrate` to create database

#### Step 2: copy all devise views into application
- `rails g devise:views` creates views/devise

#### Step 3: add action to not serve up pages until user authenticated:
add `before_action :authenticate_user!, :except => [:index, :about, :contact, :faq]` 
to application_controller just before `end`

#### Step 4: to view routes
`rake routes` to see list of existing routes
- localhost:3000/users/sign_in
- localhost:3000/users/sign_up
